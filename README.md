# RPG-ARENA

 This is a 3D RPG game with a focus on exploration, but the combat will use a third-person perspective. We hope that this game will have a strong story and narrative flow to enhance the immersive experience for players. The combat system will be wave-based, where the enemy theme will be adjusted to the location or map being explored. Initially, we planned to have three main maps: The Beginner Town, The Castle, and The End. However, the number of maps may change depending on input and suggestions from other team members. Players will have the opportunity to interact and talk to NPCs (Non-Player Characters) around the game environment. There may also be a backstory for the player character, but the details of the combat mechanics are still in development and will continue to be thought about.

This is a student project consisted of students in SMK Telkom Malang, we hope that this will goes as plan also learn a lot of things when creating this game.
